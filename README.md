# Quantifying the Value of Lateral Views in Deep Learning for Chest X-rays

This is the repo associated with the paper: [Quantifying the Value of Lateral Views in Deep Learning for Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02582 "arXiv's link"), that was published at [MIDL 2020](https://2020.midl.io/).

This repo contains the code for:
- A DenseNet implementation, modified from the [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torchvision/models/densenet.html) implementation.
- A [HeMis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05194) implementation.
- A data loader for the [PadChest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07441) dataset.
- The training and testing routine for the models.
